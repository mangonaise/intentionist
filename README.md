### [Click here to try out this project](https://intentionist.pages.dev/welcome).

Intentionist is a social habit tracking web app for friends with similar goals. It allows you to:
- create any number of habits to track
- view the history of your habits
- add friends via username
- make some habits public to your friends
- create "linked habits" with friends; these appear alongside your own, helping you stay accountable

The app was created with:
- TypeScript
- React
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- MobX
- Jest
- Theme UI (however in the future I would choose a different styling approach)
